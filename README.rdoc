# Data Sybiote Task Manager

- A task manager application that exports user data as an exposed API, for use with other projects, using the Rails framework and Postgress Database. Developed by [Alex Wong] and [Joseph Wolf].

- The aim is to present and export data in a way that is both intuitive for users to create, and flexable for developers to use in statistical analysis or data visulization.

- Use the task manager app [on Heroku].

- See a working demontration: [DataBounce] developed by [Robert Leon]
