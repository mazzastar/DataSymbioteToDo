# Data Sybiote Task Manager

- A task manager application that exports user data as an API, for use with other projects, using the Rails framework and Postgress Database. Developed by [Alex Wong](https://github.com/mazzastar) and [Joseph Wolf](https://github.com/josephwolf).

- The aim is to present and export data in a way that is both intuitive for users to create, and flexable for developers to use in statistical analysis or data visulization.

- Use the task manager app [on Heroku](http://datasymbiote.herokuapp.com/).

- See a working demontration: [DataBounce](https://github.com/llexileon/datavisual) developed by [Robert Leon](https://github.com/llexileon)
